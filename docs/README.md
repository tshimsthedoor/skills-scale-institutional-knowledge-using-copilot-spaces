# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

## Overview

OctoAcme employs a customer-first, iterative delivery framework designed to maximize value while maintaining quality and team sustainability. Our approach is guided by five core principles: prioritizing customer value at every decision point, delivering work in small testable increments to enable rapid feedback, ensuring clear ownership through named Project Managers and Product Leads for each initiative, making data-informed decisions based on measurable outcomes, and fostering psychological safety to encourage open feedback and continuous learning. Projects progress through five distinct lifecycle phases—initiation, planning, execution, release, and retrospective/continuous improvement. Each phase has specific deliverables and decision gates that ensure alignment and quality throughout the delivery process.

During initiation, teams create a Project One-pager that establishes the foundation for success by documenting the problem statement, SMART objectives, success metrics, stakeholder list, high-level timeline, and initial risk assessment. The planning phase transforms this foundation into actionable work through kickoff meetings that align the delivery team, backlog creation with clear acceptance criteria, and scope estimation using T-shirt sizing or story points. Teams establish a Definition of Done and maintain a Risk Register to proactively manage uncertainties. Risks and dependencies are tracked systematically throughout the project lifecycle, with regular reviews during weekly syncs to ensure timely mitigation and escalation when needed.

Execution follows a structured team rhythm including daily 15-minute standups focused on progress and blockers, weekly delivery syncs to demonstrate progress and flag risks, and sprint-end demos to showcase completed work to stakeholders. Work flows through a project board with clearly defined stages: Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, and Done. Pull Request standards enforce quality through small PRs (≤400 lines when possible), mandatory issue links to maintain traceability, automated CI testing and linting before review, and peer approval requirements. Quality assurance is comprehensive, incorporating unit tests for new logic, integration tests for component interactions, end-to-end smoke tests for critical user flows, and security scanning in the CI pipeline. When blockers arise, a three-level escalation process ensures rapid resolution. Level 1 handles team-level triage in daily standups, Level 2 involves PM escalation to Product Leads and dependent teams, and Level 3 triggers sponsor-level escalation when business impact is significant.

OctoAcme teams are composed of three primary personas working in close collaboration. Developers implement features, write tests, and participate in code reviews. Product Managers define the product vision, prioritize the backlog, and measure success against customer outcomes. Project Managers coordinate delivery activities, manage risks and schedules, and ensure transparent stakeholder communication. Communication follows a consistent cadence with weekly syncs between Project and Product Managers for alignment, twice-weekly standups for delivery teams, and monthly updates for broader stakeholder groups. Releases are classified as patch (critical hotfixes), minor (incremental features), or major (significant functionality changes). Each release type has standardized requirements including passing CI, security scans, release notes, and rollback plans. After each sprint or release, teams conduct timeboxed retrospectives (45-75 minutes) structured to capture what went well, what could be improved, and most importantly, 2-3 prioritized action items with clear owners and timelines that are tracked in the project backlog to ensure continuous improvement.

## Purpose and Usage

This documentation serves as OctoAcme's centralized knowledge repository for project management practices, providing a single source of truth for how we plan, execute, and deliver projects. It is designed to be a comprehensive onboarding resource for new team members, enabling them to quickly understand our processes, roles, and expectations. Current team members should use these documents as a reference guide to ensure consistent project execution across all initiatives, reducing variability and improving predictability. This is living documentation that evolves with our team's learnings—feedback and improvements are encouraged and should be captured through retrospectives and incorporated through regular updates to keep our practices aligned with our growing experience and changing needs.
